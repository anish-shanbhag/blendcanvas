# Canvas

This was a project that I started, but never quite got around to finishing. It was intended as an online coding platform for a new programming language that I was developing, but I couldn't find the time to finish creating the language, and so this site was unfortunately abandoned as well.

# Technologies

This site uses Vue.js for its front end JavaScript framework. Vuetify was also used as a material design CSS framework. Vue Routing was also used to allow for navigation around the site in a single page application.

The website has login functionality through Firebase which allows users to create accounts and save projects, although currently the projects are not editable.
